1. I spent around 3:30 on Lab2

2. I struggled to get my file to output the correctly decoded message rather than question marks. I was finnally able to fix this issue by changing my user input to and int to allow for enough bits which solved my whole issue. I noticed that creating the key and getting it correct was the essesntial to lab 2. 

4. This is what my key looked like when running GDB on bit_decode2 with input 1010

0
1
2
5
10
170

is what my binary_key printed out when I ran GDB with a break at the main. 

5. I did not run this.
